# [ Message of the day Services overrides ]########################################################
# The "40-services" service is from another repository with a default set of services to include
# within the Message of the Day screen.  This section to define a set of services to replace
# the services which are hard coded.

services_list_override:
  - "fail2ban"
  - "ufw"
  - "netdata"
  - "zed"
  - "smartd"
  - "postfix"

# The "40-services" displays service status in columns. You can set how many columns to display:
services_columns_to_display: 4

# The "36-diskstatus" option for "sed_filter" is used to help make device names smaller, easier
# to read and understand, make more human readable. For Example, the name "CT1000MX500SSD1" is
# a Crucial 1TB MX500 SSD.  This filter can be extended to rename devices name being displayed.
# each entry is "s/" (sed search), then a regular express to search with, a "/" followed by
# replacement text (or just // to simply delete the match), lastly each statement ends with "/;"

sed_filter: >-
  s/^scsi-SATA_//;
  s/^ata-//;

# Define when smartctl short and long duration test will take place.
# Format is: MM/DD/d/HH, where:

# MM = Month of the year, expressed with two decimal digits. The range is from 01 (January)
#      to 12 (December) inclusive. Do not use a single decimal digit or the match will always fail!
# DD = Day of the month, expressed with two decimal digits. The range is from 01 to 31 inclusive.
#      Do not use a single decimal digit or the match will always fail!
# d  = Day of the week, expressed with one decimal digit. The range is from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday)
#      inclusive.
# HH = Hour of the day, written with two decimal digits, and given in hours after midnight. The
#      range is 00 (midnight to just before 1am) to 23 (11pm to just before midnight) inclusive.
#      Do not use a single decimal digit or the match will always fail!

# Use a ".." as double digit and "." as any single digit.

# If smtp client is available to allow external email, set notification email address. To send email
# to more than one user, use a "comma separated" form for the address (no spaces). Reminder this

# ansible methods:  user1@address1,user2@address2,...,userN@addressN (with no spaces)

# Smartmon DEFAULT testing directives
# -a = Equivalent to turning on all of the following Directives:
#     '-H' to check the SMART health status
#     '-f' to report failures of Usage (rather than Prefail) Attributes
#     '-t' to track changes in both Prefailure and Usage Attributes
#     '-l error' to report increases in the number of ATA errors
#     '-l selftest' to report increases in the number of Self-Test Log errors
#     '-l selfteststs' to report changes of Self-Test execution status
#     '-C 197' to report nonzero values of the current pending sector count
#     '-U 198' to report nonzero values of the offline pending sector count
# -s (S/xxx|Lxxx) = Self-Test schedules
# -m = Send a warning email to one or more email address
# -M exec = run executable PATH instead of default mail command, when smartd needs to send email
